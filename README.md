## RestProject

I called this restProject with the intention of writing a rest interface but then I decovered that there's a Star Wars REST api.
So this project will be doing stuff with that API, I don't know what yet, Im just pumped to find that an Star wars API exists.

This project was created out of;
    * Liking writing code
    * Liking Star Wars
    * Attempting to learn more about Gradle, Groovy etc.
    * I need a hooby other than food
